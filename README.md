# Flight-Delay-Prediction-XGBoost-Balanced-Decision-TressPredicting flight delays before they happen using historical airline data and modern ML techniques.
ðŸš€ Overview
This project tackles a real-world classification problem: predicting whether a flight will be delayed by 60+ minutes.
Using a mix of exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and tree-based ensemble models, it delivers interpretable and high-performance predictions.
ðŸ§© Approach
Data Wrangling
Converted Date â†’ extracted month & day
Encoded categorical columns (Airline, Origin, Dest)
Created binary target is_delayed_60+
Modeling
Balanced Random Forest â†’ handled class imbalance
XGBoost (tuned with GridSearchCV) â†’ optimized for ROC-AUC
Evaluation
Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC
Validation: 70/30 train-test split
